# Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction-
A prediction of the amount a tourist will use on their safari to Tanzania



The dataset describes 6476 rows of up-to-date information on tourist expenditure collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Tanzania.The dataset was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of the tourism sector and provide an instrument that will enable sector growth.

The goal is to accurately predict tourist expenditure when visiting Tanzania.

The majority of the visitors under the age group of 25-44 came for business (18.5%), or leisure and holidays (53.2%), which is consistent with the fact that they are economically more productive. Those at the age group of 45-64 were more prominent in holiday making and visiting friends and relatives. The results further reveal that most visitors belonging to the age group of 18-24 came for leisure and holidays (55.3%) as well as volunteering (13.7%). The majority of senior citizens (65 and above) came for leisure and holidays (80.9%) and visiting friends and relatives (9.5%).

The survey covers seven departure points, namely: Julius Nyerere International Airport, Kilimanjaro International Airport, Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, and the Namanga, Tunduma, Mtukula and Manyovu border points
